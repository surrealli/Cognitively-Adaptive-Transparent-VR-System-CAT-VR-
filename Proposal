Research Proposal: Advancing Fractal Neurofeedback through LLM-Enhanced Transparent VR: The CAT-VR System
1. Title
Extending Closed-loop EEG-based Fractal Neurofeedback: Integrating LLM-Driven Cognitive Interpretation and Transparent VR for Enhanced Real-Time Cognitive State Optimization

2. Abstract
Building upon our previous demonstration that adaptive fractal visual complexity can effectively modulate focus, relaxation, and engagement through closed-loop EEG feedback, we propose to extend this paradigm by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) and transparent virtual reality. Our prior research established that real-time adjustment of Mandelbrot fractal dimension based on EEG-derived cognitive markers (Focus, Relaxation, Engagement) produced significant improvements in cognitive performance (18% improvement in fractal dimension metric, Session 5: 1.417 vs 1.199 in sham group, t = 2.108, p = 0.05). This new project will enhance our existing system by incorporating LLM-based semantic interpretation of multi-modal physiological data (EEG, eye-tracking, HRV) and generative AI for dynamic content creation within transparent VR environments. We hypothesize that this cognitively-aware mixed-reality system will significantly enhance the efficacy and personalization of cognitive state optimization compared to our original 2D fractal interface.

3. Introduction and Background
3.1 Foundation: Established Efficacy of Fractal Neurofeedback
Our previous research (Salimi & Khosrowabadi, 2023) successfully demonstrated that closed-loop fractal neurofeedback can guide cognitive states toward improved focus and relaxation. Using the EMOTIV EPOC X system with 14-electrode configuration and real-time fractal dimension adjustment (ΔD = 0.015), we established that:

Adaptive fractal stimuli significantly improve cognitive markers across sessions

The real-feedback group showed increasing fractal dimension stability (F = 2.41, p = 0.036)

Medium-complexity fractals (D ≈ 1.3-1.5) optimally modulate alpha and beta band activity

3.2 Limitations and Extension Opportunities
While our original system demonstrated efficacy, several limitations present opportunities for enhancement:

Stimulus Limitation: Restricted to 2D Mandelbrot fractals with single-parameter (D) adjustment

Interpretation Gap: Reliance on proprietary Emotiv metrics without semantic understanding

Environmental Isolation: Standard display lacking ecological validity and environmental awareness

Personalization Constraints: Fixed adaptation rules without learning across users or sessions

3.3 Research Gap and Novel Contribution
No existing system integrates our established fractal neurofeedback approach with:

LLM-driven semantic interpretation of cognitive states

Generative AI for multi-parameter stimulus adaptation

Transparent VR for environmentally-grounded interventions

Hierarchical agentic control for multi-timescale personalization

4. Research Objectives and Hypotheses
4.1 Primary Objectives
To extend our existing Python-Unity neurofeedback platform with LLM-based cognitive state interpretation and transparent VR integration

To develop a generative AI system that produces adaptive fractal and semantic content within mixed-reality environments

To validate the enhanced system against our original protocol using within-subjects comparison

4.2 Secondary Objectives
To establish whether LLM interpretation improves adaptation efficiency over our original rule-based system

To determine if transparent VR enhances ecological validity and user engagement

To develop personalized cognitive models that leverage our existing session data (N=14, 5 sessions each)

4.3 Hypotheses
H1: The LLM-enhanced system will achieve target cognitive states (focus, relaxation, engagement) 30% faster than our original parameter-only adaptation system.

H2: Transparent VR integration will improve user engagement metrics (session duration, subjective reports) while maintaining the cognitive benefits demonstrated in our 2D system.

H3: The hierarchical agentic system will demonstrate cumulative improvement across sessions, with effect sizes exceeding those observed in our original study (Cohen's d > 1.13 by session 5).
